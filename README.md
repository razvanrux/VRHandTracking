Github only allows up to 2GB of free storage. <br>

There is also a runnable package, but the development parts are removed from it - and so the whole Hand Tracking (Unreal Engine limitations) - leaving just the fixed camera. Will be fixed in the future.

In order to run the project, several components need to be installed:
1. Unreal Engine 4.26.2 from the Epic Games Store
2. Project (Packaged version not needed)
3. Steam & SteamVR
4. Oculus App & headset (using Oculus Link)
5. PC / laptop with dedicated GPU and powerful CPU (integrated might not work at all!)
